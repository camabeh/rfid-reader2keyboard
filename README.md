# rfid-reader2keyboard

This is a very simple maven project which reads the code of your rfid chip, and types it in any field.

To run, use `mvn clean install` which will create a jar file which is executable.
Alternatively, you can run `mvn clean install exec:java` to execute things directly from the CLI.

## Releases

Any successful merge to `master` is automatically available on the [Github release page](https://github.com/inventid/rfid-reader2keyboard/releases).
